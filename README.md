# cxedit - editor written in rust
A text editor completely written in rust.

Uses termios for terminal settings etc.

## Functionality
Some basic functionality that is currently working:

- [x] Editing of characters
- [x] Displaying text properly (scrolling not implemented yet... will look absurd when linecount longer than screen height)
- [x] Undo operations (redo operations is basically just popping from the "forward history" list, so it's about 95% done
- [x] Save & open from status line with Ctrl + s and Ctrl + o
- [x] Sane scrolling (nano-style scrolling)    

Functionality I'm working on or what was last implemented:

- [ ] Input modes a l√° Vim
- [ ] Redo
- [x] Jump to <line>
- [ ] Find <char range>
- [ ] Inter process communication (for use to implement calls to RLS or racer for example and other language servers)
- [ ] Syntax coloring (not relly hard at all)
 - ##### Configuration (begun on, no real functionality yet though)
    - [x] Simple default() 
- [ ] Multiple buffers & multiple views
- [ ] Overlays / "frames" inside the views
